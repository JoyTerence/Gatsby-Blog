<b>C    Em  Am       F     C    G</b>
Wise men say only fools rush in  
<b>    F  G     Am   F         C    G7   C</b>
But I can't help falling in love with you  
<b>C     Em   Am            F  C  G</b>
Shall  I  stay? Would it be a sin 
<b>   F  G     Am   F          C    G7   C</b>
If I can't help falling in love with you


<b>Em            B7     Em           B7</b>
Like a river flows, surely to the sea
<b>Em             B7     Em7         A7               Dm  G7</b>
Darling, so it goes, some things      are meant to be
<b>C    Em  Am            F     C     G</b>
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
<b>      F   G    Am   F          C    G7   C</b>
Cause I can't help falling in love with you


<b>Em            B7     Em           B7</b>
Like a river flows, surely to the sea
<b>Em             B7     Em7         A7               Dm  G7</b>
Darling, so it goes, some things      are meant to be
<b>C    Em  Am            F     C     G</b>
Take my hand, take my whole life, too
<b>      F   G    Am   F          C    G7   C</b>
Cause I can't help falling in love with you
<b>      F   G    Am   F          C    G7   C</b>
Cause I can't help falling in love with you
