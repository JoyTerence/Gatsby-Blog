Though native app development is more preferred to create apps in both Android and iOS, there has been a steady increase in the interest for building cross-platform mobile apps. Two of the popular frameworks used for cross-platform development are [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/).

React Native was introduced by Facebook in 2015. It boasts of combining best parts of native development with React and Javascript. Their motto is **"Learn once, write anywhere"**, 

React Native makes use of the native UI building blocks for rendering, which is advantageous because it not only gives a native UI feel in the apps but also can be reused for for different platforms as long as there is some way to convert the React code into Native UI. This job of converting React Native code and UI to system calls and native UI elements is done by Javascript Bridge that sits between ReactNative code and Native elements.
